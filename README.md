The app allows a "case", consisting of a collection of voice recordings, to be
brought before a "jury" for consideration.

This is an early prototype; many improvements are needed, and many enhancements are possible.
The hope is that bringing to light bullying and harassing behavior for public judgement will have a
therapeutic effect for the victim.

The justice server is a Tomcat servlet (see JusticeServer/EvenTheOdds/Readme.txt).
